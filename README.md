# Survival Analysis of Student Dropout in STEM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies survival analysis techniques to study time to dropout among STEM students at a South African university. The aim is to identify factors associated with student persistence and dropout over time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Estimate time to dropout using Kaplan–Meier survival curves
- Compare survival functions across student characteristics
- Identify significant predictors of dropout using Cox proportional hazards models

## 📊 Data
The dataset contains anonymised student records including:
- Time to dropout or completion
- Censoring indicator
- Demographic variables
- Funding status
- Academic and institutional factors

*(Note: A sample dataset is provided for demonstration purposes.)*

## 🧪 Methods
- Kaplan–Meier estimator
- Log-rank test
- Cox proportional hazards regression

## 📈 Key Outputs
- Survival curves by student characteristics
- Hazard ratios with confidence intervals
- Interpretation of statistically significant predictors

## 🛠️ Tools
- R
- survival, survminer packages
- Git & GitHub
